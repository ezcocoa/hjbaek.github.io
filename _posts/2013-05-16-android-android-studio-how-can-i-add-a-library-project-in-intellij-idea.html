<p>I don't know when does it release.<br />
That name is Android Studio.<br />
I installed it yesterday. It was organized IntelliJ.<br />
Indeed, I'm just wondering that It would be used by developers.<br />
Anyway. sometime new tool is hard to learn and to make me bothered.<br />
So I always think about that I've to find my tool.<br />
it's also hard. because there is no perfect tool in the world.<br />
That's why it has been still coming new tool.<br />
I've to decide tool which am i gonna using.<br />
<strong>Eclipse VS IntelliJ</strong><br />
Which one do you prefer to developer for android?<br />
anyway I am trying to use IntelliJ to developer android application.<br />
so i got new problem that is how can I add a "Library Project" in IntelliJ IDEA.<br />
following description is solution.<br />

You need to create a new IDEA module form the existing source code.<br />
Ensure that Android facet is enabled for this module, in the facet settings you need to enable <strong>"Is Library Project"</strong> option. Then add this module as a dependency to your main module.<br />

Thanks buddy.</p>
