<p>I've moved to use between Eclipse to Android Studio.<br />
It has still some bugs since beta version.<br />
but It's pretty good.<br />
Anyway I've got some bug that "could not fetch model of type 'IdeaProject' using Gradle Installation.<br />
I bring a solution to StackoverFlow that link is followings.<br />
// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16609666/could-not-fetch-model-of-type-ideaproject-using-gradle-installation<br />
<strong>you've to delete default files.<br />
[code]<br />
~/.android<br />
~/.gradle<br />
[/code]â€¨<br />
Above folder that when you use <strong>Android Sutido</strong> first time. it can be made automatically.<br />
after delete these files, you can see that it works well.</p>
