<p>I got some following error:</p>
<p>Terminating app due to uncaught<br />
exception 'NSInvalidUnarchiveOperationException', reason: 'Could not instantiate<br />
class named NSLayoutConstraint'</p>
<p>but It's simple.</p>
<p>you can fix it as following solution.</p>
<p>By default, when you create a new iOS project in Xcode 4.5, your storyboard or XIB is set to use Autolayout, which is a new feature in iOS 6.0. The NSLayoutConstraint class is part of the Autolayout system, and it doesn't exist in older versions of iOS.</p>
<p>If you want to deploy your app to an older version of iOS, you need to change your storyboard or XIB to not use Autolayout. It's a checkbox in the File Inspector:</p>
<p>I refer to the stack overflow.<br />
