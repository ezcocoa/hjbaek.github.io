<p>Hi<br />
This is developer who made the Instagallery application for android.<br />
I have some problem that i can't upload new version on android market now.<br />
I lost my all data of SSD for i came in Canada and I am not sure whether I can upload or can't.<br />
So I've uploaded on Dropbox server because some people want to upgrade as new version that bugs were fixed.<br />
You can download following url.<br />
<a href="http://db.tt/r2dUl7AW">Download Link</a><br />
I would upload new version formally when i come back to Korea and you can download on Google market.<br />
It would be September first.<br />
Thank you for coming and using our application.</p>
