<p>i've studied about shell.<br />
i wonder, how can i copy shell path to clipboard in shell???<br />
so i searched to google engine.<br />
this is <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/231213/os-x-how-can-i-copy-the-shell-path-to-clipboard">result page</a>.</p>
<h3>we can use 'pbcopy'script.</h3>
<p>[code]<br />
$ pwd | pbcopy<br />
[/code]<br />
There's also the program pbpaste that pastes (pb = pasteboard, i.e. clipboard).<br />
thank you!!</p>
