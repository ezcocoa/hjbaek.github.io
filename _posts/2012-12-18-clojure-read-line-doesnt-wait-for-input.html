<p><strong>"lein run"</strong>을 이용하여 <strong>(read-line)</strong> 함수를 사용하는 중에 문제가 발생하였다.</p>
<p>(read-line) 함수는  (. (new java.util.Scanner (. System in)) nextLine)]와 동일하다.</p>
<p>문제의 원인은 leiningen은 새로운 프로세스를 생성하여 사용하므로 사용자 콘솔에 접근을 할 수 없다는 문제이다.</p>
<p>ref : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7707558/clojure-read-line-doesnt-wait-for-input</p>
<h2>Try "lein trampoline run". See</h2>
<pre><code> Q: I don't have access to stdin inside my project.
 A: There's a problem in the library that
Leiningen uses to spawn new processes that blocks access to console input.
This means that functions like read-line will not work as expected in most contexts,
though the repl task necessarily includes a workaround.
You can also use the trampoline task to launch
your project's JVM after Leiningen's has exited rather than launching it as a subprocess.
</code></pre>
