<p>It's from <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">help.github.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Check for SSH keys</h3>
<pre>
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ls -al
#Lists the files in your .ssh directory
</pre>
<p>Check the directory listing to see if you have files named wither <strong>id_rsa.pub</strong> or <strong>id_dsa.pub</strong>. If you don't have either of those files go to <strong>step 2.</strong> Otherwise. you can skip to step 3.</p>
<h3>Step 2: generate a new SSH Key</h3>
<p>To generate a new SSH key, copy and paste the text below, making sure to substitute in your email.<br />
The default settings are preferred, so when you're asked to "enter a file in which to save the key, "" just press enter to continue.</p>
<pre>
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
# Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label
Generating public/private rya key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
</pre>
<p>Next, you'll be asked to enter a passphrase.</p>
<pre>
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
</pre>
<p>Which should give you something like this:</p>
<pre>
Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is :
01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@example.com
</pre>
<p>Then add your new key to the ssh-agent:</p>
<pre>
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</pre>
